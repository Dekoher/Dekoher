##### In the last two years I've been learning about the amazing world of software development, focused in the web side, specifically in the Frontend :man_technologist: , but I've also had to learn a little bit of Backend to complement the apps I've contributed.

##### Some of my tech skills are:

```javascript
function diegoHerrera() {
  return mySkills = {
    languages: ['JavaScript', 'Python'],
    frontend: {
      core: ['HTML', 'CSS', 'Responsive design', 'Bootstrap', 'Sass', 'Less', 'Materialize', 'MaterialUI'],
      librariesAndFrameworks: ['Angular', 'ReactJs', 'Gatsby'],
      unitTest: ['Jest', 'Jasmine']
    },
    backend: ['Node.js', 'Express.js']
  }
}
```

##### In my free times i like to learn about new technologies on my own, mix some music, and do maker IoT projects, with raspberry pi, arduino, ESP8266, etc.

##### You can speak to me in Spanish of course because I'm Mexican ðŸ˜ƒðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½ and also in English.
